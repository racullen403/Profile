Javascript Object Notation

Typically used to pass data through API calls.

We have an inbuilt package, import json 

JSON is formatted as so

    {
        "key": value,
        "key": {
            "key": ...,
            "key": ...
        }
    }

Note that keys are strings,and values can be strings, numbers, arrays, objects, etc...

Typically we will import our JSON data in some way, as a string, and parse it using json.loads(data), this will turn it into a workable python dictionary.
We can also convert a python object into JSON using json.dumps(obj) (limited to dict, list, tuple, string, int, float, True, False, None).

We can make the JSON more readable with json.dumps(obj, indent=4)

JSON can be used to securely send data through JSON Web Signatures (JWS), composed of header, payload and signature.
    - Header specifies the type of token and signing algorithm (encryption).
    - Payload is the data being transmitted, commonly JSON but not always.
    - Signature is constructed by applying the encryption algo in the header to the base64 version of the header and payload joined by a dot.
