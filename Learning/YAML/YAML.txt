Yet ANother Markup Language

Used to format configuation files and can be used in place of JSON a lot due to the object serialization. However we typically use for configuaration.

Can use extension yaml or yml

Start and separate YAML documents with 3 dashes 

--- 

Use indentation of 2 whitespace for nesting, newlines indicate end of field.


somefile.yml 
---
key1: "value1"
key2: "value2" 
key3:
  key4: ...
  key5: ...
...
---
key1: "value3"
key4: "value4"
key3:
  key4: ...
  key5: ...

This yml has 2 documents in it, where each has 3 keys, note key3 is a nested dictionary with keys key4 and key5. We separate them with --- at the start and ... at the end.


We can list multiple values as follows

key1:
  - value1 
  - value2
  - value3



To parse the YAML file we import yaml (need to instal pyyaml), then use the yaml.load() on the file to get the data into a dictionary format.

We can comment in files the same as python with # in line

Values are generally recognised and converted to the correct data type, ie string, int, flaot, hexidecimal, we represent non numbers as .Nan, .Inf, -.Inf. None is ~ or null.
Booleans are True/On/Yes and False/Off/No.

Arrays with - as above, or [1, 2, 3]

We can do the same with dictionarys, using the indentation or {....}
